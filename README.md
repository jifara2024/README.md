# Jifara Dabessa Gemechu

Experienced Management Information System (MIS) Consultant with a strong academic background in Computer Science, Remote Sensing & Geoinformatics, and Water Resources Engineering. Passionate about leveraging data, GIS, and technology for improved decision-making and service delivery in the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WaSH) sector.

## About Me

I am a professional with a blend of expertise in information systems, spatial data analysis, and water resources management. My career has focused on developing and implementing Management Information Systems (MIS), utilizing GIS and Remote Sensing technologies, and contributing to the planning and execution of water supply and sanitation projects. I have extensive experience in data management, analysis, visualization, and training, particularly within the WaSH sector in Ethiopia.

MIS is a structured system for collecting, processing, storing, and disseminating information to support decision-making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization. Key components include data collection, processing, storage, dissemination, and decision support. MIS is vital for water supply and energy for data-driven decision making, improving operational efficiency, resource allocation, performance monitoring, and stakeholder engagement. WaSH-MIS specifically is important for the Ministry of Water and Energy in Ethiopia for its integrated approach to water, sanitation, and hygiene, enhancing service delivery, improving health outcomes, supporting policy formulation, capacity building, and resource mobilization.
